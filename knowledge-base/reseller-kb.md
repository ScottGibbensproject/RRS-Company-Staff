## Frequently Asked Questions

### If I decide to stop selling the software, do I still get paid?

**Yes** - Section 8.4B covers this.

> *B. Residuals. Except where termination results from ISO's willful misconduct or fraud, EPI shall continue to pay ISO its earned residual base commissions for active Merchants originated by ISO, in accordance with Section 5.2 and Schedule A, for so long as EPI receives corresponding compensation from its processor or Member.*

### Are there quotas or minimums?

**No** - there are no quotas or minimums required to receive your residual payment each month.

### What if you sell the company?

This is covered in Section 8.4F.

**Portfolio Sale or Company Sale:** If RRS sells all or substantially all of its software business, merchant portfolio, or residual revenue stream, each reseller in good standing shall be entitled to a one-time **Portfolio Payout** calculated as:

**Portfolio Payout = Average monthly commission (preceding 12 months) × Sale Multiple**

- Default sale multiple: **25×** (unless negotiated otherwise)
- Payment timing: Within 60 days after RRS receives sale proceeds
- Eligibility: Must be in good standing, no material breach

**Example:** If a reseller earned an average of $2,000/month over 12 months and the sale multiple is 25×, the reseller receives $2,000 × 25 = **$50,000**

### What if a shop I visit wants processing without the software?

If we provided the initial lead or are actively marketing your area on your behalf, then we expect you will still board the account with us, even if they are not yet ready to use the software. However, if the shop is someone you had already spoken with before joining us, then you are not expected to board that account with us.

### Do you offer exclusive territory?

**No** - We no longer offer exclusive areas and there are no plans to do so.

### Can I sell this anywhere?

In most cases, **yes** - you may offer our software in any area. If we are already working with another reseller in a particular area, we prefer not to overlap. Please check with us first when we establish your preferred areas.

### Is there a rev share on the software fee?

**No** - As a new startup, our overhead is disproportionate to our revenue. At this time, we are not able to offer a revenue share on the monthly software fee.

### If the shop qualifies for Cygma Tier F (higher residual), who pays for the terminal?

The Dejavoo P1 is listed at **$239**, and we can split the cost. There is a link in the member area to make your portion of the payment.
